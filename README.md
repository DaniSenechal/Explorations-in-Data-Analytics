# Explorations in Data Analytics (ECSU)
These are several projects from EDA at ECSU. They were all coded in R, and along with the R Scripts, I uploaded the Word documents with the answers/analysis 
to the prompted questions.

## Technologies
Projects were created with:
* RStudio: R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05).

## Installation
Install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to run the code.
Download the following packages by typing these commands in the terminal. These packages are loaded in the available code.  
```bash
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("magrittr")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("Hmisc")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("car")
install.packages("psych")
```

The data sets used were also uploaded, and correspond as follows:  
  
adult.csv : Homeworks 2 and 3  
housing_train.csv : Homework 4  
adult01.csv : Project 1  
Batting.csv : Project 2  
  
 Download the data and read it in R by using the command:
```bash
name <- read.csv("your directory")
```
where "your directory" is the pathname of the data file, and name can be changed to a variable name that more accurately represents the data set.


## Status
These projects are all completed. 

## Inspiration
These projects were completed for MAT 374: Explorations in Data Analysis at ECSU in the Fall of 2019.
